## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub.com and create new repository "UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen"
2. Use "Upload files" to drag and drop all directories and files
3. Maintain the exact directory structure shown above
4. Commit with message: "Add initial project templates and directory structure"

### Option 2: Git Command Line
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /home/ubuntu/UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial project templates and directory structure

- Created comprehensive directory structure with /docs, /drafts, and /agent folders
- Added 12 template files with professional content and placeholder sections
- Established foundation for AI-embodied nanotechnology research project
- Includes roadmap, collaboration guidelines, system architecture, and agent directives"

# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: GitHub Token Troubleshooting
If you want to retry the automated deployment:
1. Verify GitHub token has "Contents: Read and Write" permissions
2. Check token expiration date
3. Ensure token is properly configured in the integration
4. Repository owner should match your GitHub username/organization
