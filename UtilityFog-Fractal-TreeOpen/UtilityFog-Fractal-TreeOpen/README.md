# UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen

## Project Vision
An open-source exploration of AI-embodied nanotechnology through fractal tree structures and utility fog mechanics. This repository serves as a collaborative platform for advancing theoretical frameworks, simulation models, and practical implementations of distributed intelligent systems at the nanoscale.
