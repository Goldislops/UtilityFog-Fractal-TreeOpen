# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning

- **CodeQL Analysis**: Automated vulnerability scanning on every push and PR
- **OSSF Scorecard**: Weekly supply chain security assessment
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated via Dependabot with security updates
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials with attestations

### Supply Chain Security

- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires PR reviews and status checks
- **Signed Commits**: Encouraged for all contributions
- **Dependency Pinning**: All dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- **Provenance**: SLSA provenance generation for releases

### Security Best Practices

- **Least Privilege**: All workflows use minimal required permissions
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets in repository
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling prevents information disclosure

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

### 2. Report privately via GitHub Security Advisories

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Goldislops/UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### 3. Alternative reporting methods

If GitHub Security Advisories are not available, you can:

- Email: [Create an issue](https://github.com/Goldislops/UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen/issues/new) with title "SECURITY: [Brief Description]" and mark it as confidential
- Include your contact information for follow-up

### 4. What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: Every 5 business days until resolution
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies by severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-30 days
  - Medium: 30-90 days
  - Low: 90+ days

### 5. Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure principles
- Security fixes will be released before public disclosure
- We will credit reporters (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- Public disclosure typically occurs 90 days after fix release

## Security Considerations for Users

### Installation Security

```bash
# Verify package integrity when installing from PyPI
pip install utilityfog-fractal-tree --require-hashes

# Or install from verified source
git clone https://github.com/Goldislops/UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen.git
cd UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen
# Verify commit signatures if available
git verify-commit HEAD
pip install -e .
```

### Runtime Security

- **Network Security**: All network communications should use TLS
- **Input Validation**: Validate all configuration files and user inputs
- **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions for configuration files

### Configuration Security

```python
# Example secure configuration
config = {
    "telemetry": {
        "export_sensitive_data": False,
        "anonymize_user_data": True,
        "secure_transport": True
    },
    "logging": {
        "log_level": "INFO",  # Avoid DEBUG in production
        "sanitize_logs": True
    }
}
```

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

Our security model addresses:

1. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Dependency verification and SBOM generation
2. **Code Injection**: Input validation and sanitization
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Secure data handling and minimal data collection
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Least privilege principles
5. **Denial of Service**: Rate limiting and resource management

### Security Controls

| Control Type | Implementation |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Preventive** | Branch protection, code review, input validation |
| **Detective** | CodeQL scanning, dependency monitoring, logging |
| **Corrective** | Automated patching, incident response procedures |
| **Recovery** | Backup procedures, rollback capabilities |

## Compliance and Standards

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Aligned with core functions
- **OWASP Top 10**: Mitigations implemented for common vulnerabilities
- **SLSA**: Supply chain security framework compliance
- **OpenSSF**: Best practices implementation
