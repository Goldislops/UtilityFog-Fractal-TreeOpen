# Foglet Coordination Algorithms

Distributed consensus and coordination protocols for microscopic robot swarms in utility fog applications.

## Overview

This module implements the core coordination algorithms that enable millions of microscopic robots (foglets) to work together as a coherent system. The algorithms handle consensus, spatial coordination, resource allocation, and communication in highly dynamic environments.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Consensus Protocol
Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement for configuration changes across the swarm.

### 2. Spatial Coordination  
3D positioning and collision avoidance for dense swarms operating in physical space.

### 3. Resource Allocation
Dynamic distribution of computational and energy resources across the network.

### 4. Communication Routing
Efficient message passing in highly dynamic topologies with frequent topology changes.

## Implementation Status
ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Core algorithms designed, implementation in progress.

For detailed implementation and usage examples, see the main [algorithms documentation](../README.md).
