# Memetic Propagation Algorithms

Viral spread models for idea adoption and community engagement based on Susan Blackmore's memetic theory.

## Overview

This module implements algorithms for understanding and optimizing how ideas, behaviors, and cultural patterns spread through communities. These algorithms are essential for user adoption, community building, and knowledge transfer in complex systems.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Epidemiological Models
SIR/SEIR models adapted for idea transmission and cultural evolution.

### 2. Network Effect Amplification
Leveraging social connections and network topology for viral spread optimization.

### 3. Engagement Optimization
Maximizing user retention, participation, and long-term community involvement.

### 4. Cultural Evolution
Long-term adaptation of community norms, practices, and collective behaviors.

## Implementation Status
ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Engagement models designed, A/B testing framework ready.

For detailed implementation and usage examples, see the main [algorithms documentation](../README.md).
