# Fractal Growth Algorithms

Self-organizing tree structures with self-similar expansion patterns for hierarchical system organization.

## Overview

This module implements algorithms for creating and managing fractal tree structures that can grow, adapt, and self-repair. These structures serve as the organizational backbone for distributed systems with trillions of coordinated components.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. L-System Evolution
Lindenmayer system implementations for biological-inspired growth patterns.

### 2. Resource-Constrained Growth
Optimization of expansion under limited computational and physical resources.

### 3. Self-Repair Mechanisms
Detection and correction of structural damage in distributed tree networks.

### 4. Hierarchical Coordination
Multi-level organization from individual branches to entire forest ecosystems.

## Implementation Status
ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Mathematical models defined, implementation in progress.

For detailed implementation and usage examples, see the main [algorithms documentation](../README.md).
