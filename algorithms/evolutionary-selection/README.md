# Evolutionary Selection Algorithms

Genetic algorithm implementations for multi-objective system optimization and emergent behavior discovery.

## Overview

This module implements evolutionary algorithms that enable systems to improve over time through variation, selection, and adaptation. These algorithms optimize everything from individual component behavior to system-wide performance characteristics.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms
Pareto-optimal solutions for competing objectives in complex optimization landscapes.

### 2. Genetic Programming
Evolution of code structures and algorithmic behaviors through programmatic selection.

### 3. Coevolutionary Systems
Multiple populations evolving in interaction, creating complex adaptive dynamics.

### 4. Fitness Landscape Analysis
Understanding and navigating optimization spaces for improved convergence.

## Implementation Status
ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Initial population dynamics simulated, fitness functions defined.

For detailed implementation and usage examples, see the main [algorithms documentation](../README.md).
