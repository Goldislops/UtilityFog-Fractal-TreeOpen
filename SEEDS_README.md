# UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen

A visionary framework to explore AI-embodied nanotechnology through utility fog, fractal tree embodiment, and programmable matter — combining evolutionary algorithms, distributed computing, and gamification for future machine intelligence design.

## Mission
To create a path toward programmable matter and self-healing nanotech structures using:
- Utility fog / programmable matter concepts
- Fractal tree embodiment (trillions of self-repairing branches that coordinate foglets)
- Evolutionary machines based on digital ecology
- Distributed computing on internet-scale resources
- Gamification strategies powered by compelling memes (inspired by Susan Blackmore’s work)
