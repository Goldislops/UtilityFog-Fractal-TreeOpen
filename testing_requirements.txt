# Testing Framework Requirements for UtilityFog-Fractal-TreeOpen

# Core Python packages (typically included in standard Python installations)
# These are needed for the simulation system to run properly

# Data analysis and processing
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.20.0

# Network analysis (used in network_topology.py)
networkx>=2.6

# Optional: Enhanced data visualization (for future extensions)
# matplotlib>=3.3.0
# seaborn>=0.11.0

# Development and testing utilities
# pytest>=6.0.0  # For future unit testing extensions
# pytest-cov>=2.0.0  # For code coverage analysis

# Note: Most functionality uses only Python standard library
# The core simulation should work with minimal dependencies
