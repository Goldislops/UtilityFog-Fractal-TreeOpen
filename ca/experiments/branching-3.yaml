  description: "Test multi-state branching growth on 3D lattice"
  hypothesis: "Rule should produce stable branching structures with lambda ~1.5"
  expected_outcomes:
    - "Branching factor converges to 1.0-2.0 (edge of chaos)"
    - "Connectivity remains > 0.8 (highly connected)"
    - "Survival > 0.5 (stable structures)"
