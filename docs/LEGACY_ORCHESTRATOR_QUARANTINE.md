# Legacy Tuning Orchestrator — Quarantine

> **What this is.** `scripts/orchestrator.py` (Phase 18 PR 6), historically

## The three enforced boundaries

**R — server-side auto-commit refusal** (`scripts/tuning_api.py`). The commit
endpoint refuses the orchestrator's autonomous approver identity
(`approver="policy:auto"` → `403 auto_commit_disabled`), checked before the
human-approval branch, for every parameter category. There is no env flag,
query param, header, or alternate route that re-enables it; re-enablement
requires a reviewed code change. Human commits (`approver="human:<name>"`),
reads, dry-run/propose, LOCKED-at-propose rejection, and the per-parameter rate
limit are unchanged.

**S — observe-by-default capability model** (`scripts/orchestrator.py`,
`scripts/orchestrator_config.py`). The LLM-facing surface is capability-gated:

| Mode | Observation tools | Proposal tool | Commit tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| `observe` (default) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `propose` | ✅ | ✅ (forced `dry-run`; `commit-pending` refused) | ❌ |

`commit_tuning` is **never** registered as an LLM-facing router handler in any
mode. Mode resolution (`resolve_mode` / `MEDUSA_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE`) fails closed:
absent, malformed, or unknown values all resolve to `observe`; only the exact
tokens `observe`/`propose` are honored, and only `propose` exposes any
write-adjacent tool. The low-level `OrchestratorClient.commit_tuning` /
`rollback_tuning` primitives are retained for direct **non-LLM** callers and are
proven unable to enter the tool registry.

**T — hard runtime limits, honest error semantics, bounded audit receipts**
(`scripts/orchestrator.py`). Two validated budgets bound each iteration: a
per-turn `max_tool_depth` and a total `max_total_tool_calls` (both positive
integers within `MAX_LIMIT_CEILING`; malformed values are rejected at
construction). When a turn's tool calls would exceed the total budget, only the
permitted prefix executes; every remaining call gets an explicit
`budget_rejection` error result so the conversation history stays structurally
valid, and the iteration stops (`tool_budget_exhausted`) — the cap is never
exceeded. At most one proposal attempt per iteration is enforced in code. Tool
outcomes are categorized (`ok`, `unknown_tool`, `handler_exception`,
`transport_failure`, `http_rejection`, `budget_rejection`, `proposal_limit`,
`local_rejection`); HTTP status ≥ 400 is a genuine tool error and is never
counted as a created proposal or applied commit.

Error-shape guarantees (Jack amendment):

- **Non-dict handler returns** — the handler call, its return-shape check, and
  the `_status`/`_local_rejection` inspection all run inside one defensive
  `try`, so a handler that returns `None`, a list, a scalar, or any non-dict
  becomes a bounded `handler_exception` result and can never crash the loop.
- **`local_rejection`** — a request the router refuses *before* any HTTP call
  (blank justification, forbidden `commit-pending`) is flagged `is_error=True`
  with category `local_rejection`, counted as an error (not `ok`), and — since
  no request is sent — never mints a proposal id. Distinct from
  `http_rejection`, where the server said no.
- **Error visibility across transports** — an `is_error` result is surfaced by
  native backends via the `is_error` flag and by the OpenAI-compatible backend
  via a leading `[ERROR]` marker, so a model recognises the failure either way.
- **Fixed refusal messages** — every router/orchestrator-minted failure text
  is a fixed string: `tool not registered` (unknown or non-str tool name; the
  supplied name is never echoed, hashed, converted, or type-reported, and the
  registry lookup itself runs inside the defensive `try`), `tool handler
  failed`, `URLError`, and `tool result unavailable` (refused result, below).
- **Exact-dictionary and exact-JSON-tree acceptance** — a handler result is
  accepted only when it is exactly a builtin `dict`, and it reaches the model
  only after validating as an exact builtin JSON tree: exact `dict`s with
  exact-`str` keys, exact `list`s, exact `str`/`int`/finite-`float`/`bool`/
  `None`. Subclasses, tuples, foreign objects, cycles, non-finite floats,
  depth > 32 (`MAX_TOOL_RESULT_DEPTH`), and > 4096 cumulative items
  (`MAX_TOOL_RESULT_ITEMS`) are all refused by exact-type decisions — no
  conversion, representation, formatting, iteration, comparison, length, or
  truth method of a refused value is requested.
- **128 KiB tool-result ceiling** — an accepted result serializes with plain
  `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True, allow_nan=False)` (no `default=str`, so no
  foreign `__str__` can enter model-visible text) and its UTF-8 encoding must
  fit `MAX_TOOL_RESULT_BYTES` (128 KiB); cumulative string size is bounded
  during validation, before serialization. Any refusal — validation,
  serialization, or size — is replaced by the fixed block
  `{"error": "tool_result_unavailable", "category": "handler_exception",
  "message": "tool result unavailable"}` with `is_error=True`, records
  exactly one `handler_exception`, collects no id, and the iteration
  continues. Ordinary JSON payloads serialize byte-identically to before.
- **Reserved response-marker stripping** — `_status` and `_local_rejection`
  are internal router markers only. Both are stripped from every dict
  response body; on an exactly-builtin-int transport status ≥ 400 the actual
  transport status is re-inserted as the authoritative `_status`. A response
  body can never supply, replace, or imitate an internal marker.
- **Outcome-category allowlisting** — recorded outcomes are never coerced: an
  error result's category survives only as an exact builtin `str` inside the
  known error categories (`ok` excluded); absent, malformed, or unknown
  categories record `handler_exception`, and success records only `ok`, so no
  arbitrary value can become an `outcome_counts` key.
- **Live ids vs. receipt-canonical ids** — a live result's
  `proposal_id` is collected only as an exact builtin non-empty `str` of at
  most 64 chars (`MAX_LIVE_RESULT_ID_LEN`); invalid values are omitted
  without conversion or truth testing. This live bound is deliberately
  looser than the audit receipt's canonical `_ID_RE`
  (`^prop-[0-9a-f]{8}$`), which continues to govern receipt content
  independently — the two contracts are distinct by design.

## LeanCTX audit receipt

`IterationResult.audit_receipt()` returns a bounded, deterministic,
payload-free handoff (`build_audit_receipt`) built by **strict allowlist
normalization** — the receipt carries only a fixed schema, and any value
outside it is discarded or replaced by a fixed token, never stringified:

| Field | Supported domain | Out-of-domain handling |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | fixed literal `leanctx-orchestrator-v1` | — |
| `stopped_because` | `end_turn` / `max_depth` / `tool_budget_exhausted` | any other value → `unknown` (text never copied) |
| `turns`, `tool_calls_executed` | non-negative int, magnitude-clamped (≤ 10¹²) | bool/negative/non-int → `0`; oversized → clamped |
| `outcome_counts` | only the known categories (`ok`, `unknown_tool`, `handler_exception`, `transport_failure`, `http_rejection`, `budget_rejection`, `proposal_limit`, `local_rejection`) → non-negative ints | unknown / non-string keys discarded |
| `usage_total` | only `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` → non-negative ints | other keys discarded |
| `proposals_created`, `commits_applied` | canonical proposal ids only — `prop-` + 8 lowercase hex (`^prop-[0-9a-f]{8}$`, as minted by `tuning_api._new_proposal_id`), list-capped at 64 | secret-looking / arbitrary-valid / uppercase / overlong / non-string entries omitted (no `__str__`) |
| `truncated` | `true` whenever any value was normalized away, or the trim loop / minimal fallback fired | — |

Because every surviving value is a bounded JSON primitive, it serializes with
ordinary `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)` (no `default=str`), the ≤ 64 KiB
(`MAX_RECEIPT_BYTES`) bound holds **before** serialization, and no arbitrary
input key, secret-looking text, or object `__str__` can enter the receipt. A
deterministic trim loop and a fixed minimal fallback are the final size
guarantee. The receipt **never** contains tool payloads, prompts, credentials,
headers, or raw backend responses.

## Supported modes and invocation

`observe` is the default for any construction path (bare `Orchestrator`,
`create_orchestrator`, or `MEDUSA_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE` unset/garbage). A human who
wants dry-run proposal validation sets `MEDUSA_ORCHESTRATOR_MODE=propose`. No
supported configuration exposes an LLM-facing commit.

## Non-claims

- Not general API authentication or security — only the `policy:auto` path is
  closed at the server.
- Not a completed Glass-Wall — this quarantines one write-capable module.
- Not a statement about live engine behavior, production deployment, or
  statistical validity.
- Rollback is **not** exposed to the LLM in any mode.

## Rollback (per package)

- **T:** revert `scripts/orchestrator.py` budget/receipt additions and remove
  this document; capability model (S) and server refusal (R) remain.
- **S:** revert the capability-model changes to
  `scripts/orchestrator.py` / `orchestrator_config.py`; the server refusal (R)
  remains as the backstop.
- **R:** revert the `_commit_locked` `auto_commit_disabled` guard in
  `scripts/tuning_api.py`. (Doing so re-opens the autonomous commit path — a
  reviewed decision, by design.)

## Relationship to the offline detector (PR #322)

The proposed offline Swarm Hunter detector reads immutable evidence and surfaces
candidates for human review; it has no write path. This quarantine is the
disposition of the pre-existing *tuning* orchestrator that #322's evidence pass
uncovered. The offline detector must never import, or be imported by, this
orchestrator — a one-directional boundary asserted by a static-import test in
`tests/test_orchestrator.py`.
