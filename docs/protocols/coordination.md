# Parent↔Child Coordination Protocol

## Overview

The Parent↔Child Coordination Protocol defines the communication patterns and state management for hierarchical coordination in the Fractal Tree system. This protocol ensures consistent state transitions, reliable command propagation, and proper error handling between parent and child nodes.

## Protocol Specification

### State Model

Each node maintains coordination state with its parent and children:

```python
class CoordinationState(Enum):
    DISCONNECTED = "disconnected"    # No active coordination
    CONNECTING = "connecting"        # Establishing coordination
    SYNCHRONIZED = "synchronized"   # Active coordination established
    DEGRADED = "degraded"           # Partial coordination (some children unavailable)
    FAILED = "failed"               # Coordination failure
```

### Message Types

#### Parent → Child Messages
- `COORD_INIT`: Initialize coordination session
- `COORD_COMMAND`: Execute coordination command
- `COORD_SYNC`: Synchronize state
- `COORD_HEARTBEAT`: Maintain connection
- `COORD_SHUTDOWN`: Graceful shutdown

#### Child → Parent Messages
- `COORD_ACK`: Acknowledge coordination message
- `COORD_STATUS`: Report current status
- `COORD_ERROR`: Report error condition
- `COORD_READY`: Signal readiness for coordination
- `COORD_COMPLETE`: Signal command completion

### Coordination Lifecycle

1. **Initialization Phase**
   - Parent sends `COORD_INIT` to children
   - Children respond with `COORD_READY` or `COORD_ERROR`
   - Parent transitions to `SYNCHRONIZED` when all children ready

2. **Active Coordination Phase**
   - Parent sends commands via `COORD_COMMAND`
   - Children execute and respond with `COORD_COMPLETE` or `COORD_ERROR`
   - Periodic `COORD_HEARTBEAT` maintains connection

3. **Error Handling Phase**
   - Failed children report `COORD_ERROR`
   - Parent may transition to `DEGRADED` state
   - Recovery attempts or graceful degradation

4. **Shutdown Phase**
   - Parent sends `COORD_SHUTDOWN`
   - Children acknowledge and clean up
   - Coordination session terminated

### State Transition Rules

```
DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING: On coordination request
CONNECTING → SYNCHRONIZED: All children ready
CONNECTING → FAILED: Initialization timeout/error
SYNCHRONIZED → DEGRADED: Some children fail
SYNCHRONIZED → FAILED: Critical failure
DEGRADED → SYNCHRONIZED: Failed children recover
DEGRADED → FAILED: Too many failures
FAILED → DISCONNECTED: After cleanup
```

### Error Handling

- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts for each phase
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with available children
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry and manual recovery

### Performance Considerations

- **Batch Operations**: Group multiple commands for efficiency
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute commands on children in parallel
- **State Caching**: Cache coordination state to reduce overhead
- **Heartbeat Optimization**: Adaptive heartbeat intervals

## Implementation Notes

This is a skeleton specification for Phase 2 implementation. Full protocol details will be developed during implementation phase.
