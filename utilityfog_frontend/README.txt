Quantum Myelin Symbolic Module

Files:
- quantum_myelin.py: Core function that mimics entangled behavior between agents
- sample_integration.py: Example of how to integrate the myelin layer in a simulation loop

This symbolic abstraction is inspired by recent theoretical work on entangled photons in the myelin sheath and
is meant for conceptual modeling, not actual quantum simulation.

Run or import the integration sample to test the interaction logic.
