**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Related Documents:** [Implementation Plan](./plan.fractal-tree-mvp.md) | [Tasks](./tasks.fractal-tree-mvp.md)

## Overview

The Fractal Tree MVP establishes the foundational architecture for self-organizing, hierarchical structures within the UtilityFog ecosystem. This specification defines the core components needed to demonstrate fractal tree embodiment with basic coordination capabilities.

## User Stories

### Primary Users
- **Researchers**: Studying emergent behavior in distributed systems
- **Developers**: Building upon the fractal tree framework
- **Simulators**: Running experiments with programmable matter concepts

### Core User Stories

**US-1**: As a researcher, I want to visualize fractal tree structures so that I can observe emergent hierarchical patterns.

**US-2**: As a developer, I want a modular fractal tree API so that I can extend functionality for specific use cases.

**US-3**: As a simulator, I want configurable tree parameters so that I can experiment with different growth patterns and behaviors.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Fractal Tree Structure
- **FR-1.1**: Support hierarchical node organization with parent-child relationships
- **FR-1.2**: Implement recursive branching patterns with configurable depth limits
- **FR-1.3**: Maintain tree topology metadata (depth, branch count, leaf nodes)
- **FR-1.4**: Support dynamic tree modification (add/remove branches)

### FR-2: Node Coordination
- **FR-2.1**: Enable message passing between parent and child nodes
- **FR-2.2**: Implement basic consensus mechanisms for tree-wide decisions
- **FR-2.3**: Support local decision-making at branch level
- **FR-2.4**: Provide conflict resolution for competing branch operations

### FR-3: Visualization & Monitoring
- **FR-3.1**: Generate real-time tree structure visualizations
- **FR-3.2**: Display node states and communication flows
- **FR-3.3**: Export tree snapshots for analysis
- **FR-3.4**: Provide performance metrics (message latency, tree depth, etc.)

### FR-4: Configuration & Extensibility
- **FR-4.1**: Support YAML-based configuration for tree parameters
- **FR-4.2**: Provide plugin architecture for custom node behaviors
- **FR-4.3**: Enable runtime parameter adjustment
- **FR-4.4**: Support multiple tree instances in single simulation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Support trees with up to 10,000 nodes in MVP
- Message propagation latency < 100ms for tree depth â‰¤ 10
- Memory usage scales linearly with node count

### NFR-2: Reliability
- Graceful handling of node failures
- Tree structure recovery mechanisms
- Data consistency during concurrent operations

### NFR-3: Usability
- Clear API documentation with examples
- Interactive configuration interface
- Comprehensive error messages and logging

## Technical Constraints

- **TC-1**: Must integrate with existing UtilityFog agent architecture
- **TC-2**: Python 3.8+ compatibility required
- **TC-3**: Web-based visualization using modern browsers
- **TC-4**: Configuration via YAML files
- **TC-5**: Modular design for future extensibility

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
- **AC-1**: Successfully create and visualize fractal trees with 3+ levels
- **AC-2**: Demonstrate message passing from root to all leaf nodes
- **AC-3**: Show dynamic tree modification without structure corruption
- **AC-4**: Achieve target performance metrics under load testing
- **AC-5**: Complete integration with existing agent simulation framework

### Validation Methods
- Unit tests for all core tree operations
- Integration tests with UtilityFog agent system
- Performance benchmarking with various tree configurations
- User acceptance testing with visualization interface

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- UtilityFog Agent Package (existing)
- Network topology module (existing)
- Simulation metrics framework (existing)

### External Dependencies
- NetworkX (graph operations)
- Plotly/D3.js (visualization)
- PyYAML (configuration)
- asyncio (async coordination)

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **R-1**: Tree structure corruption during concurrent modifications
  - *Mitigation*: Implement atomic operations and tree locking mechanisms

### Medium Risk
- **R-2**: Performance degradation with large trees
  - *Mitigation*: Implement lazy loading and tree pruning strategies
- **R-3**: Complex debugging of distributed tree behaviors
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive logging and visualization tools

### Low Risk
- **R-4**: Integration challenges with existing codebase
  - *Mitigation*: Incremental integration with backward compatibility

## Future Considerations

- Multi-tree coordination and merging
- Advanced evolutionary algorithms for tree optimization
- Integration with physical simulation engines
- Distributed tree computation across multiple machines
